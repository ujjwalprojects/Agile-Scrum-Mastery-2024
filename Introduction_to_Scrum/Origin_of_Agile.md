# Origin of Agile


Agile is a methodology that originated in the software development industry as a response to the inefficiencies and rigidity of traditional project management approaches. It emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility in responding to changing requirements.

## Key Points:
- **Roots in the 1990s:** Agile principles began emerging in the 1990s as a reaction to the challenges faced in software development, particularly with traditional Waterfall models.
- **Agile Manifesto:** In 2001, a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto, which outlined core values and principles that define Agile methodologies.
- **Core Values:** The four core values of Agile include individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

## Why Agile?
